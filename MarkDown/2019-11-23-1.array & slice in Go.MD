Array in Go just like Array in C++ ,it is inflexible.
Slice in Go just like vector in C++ ,it is flexible.
1. The slice type is an abstraction built on top of Go's array type
2. A slice is a descriptor of an array segment. It consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity (the maximum length of the segment).
